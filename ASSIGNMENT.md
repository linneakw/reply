# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> I didn't realize you could provide alternate variable names by saying var x, y = 1; One aspect of the module's code was the examples. The comments weren't very clear on the actual index.js file, so when I saw the different ways it was put into action it really helped me understand how the functions were written and what their purpose was. I learned to use the library by commenting closely, and understanding how the methods and callback methods interacted with one another. 

One change that would have made it easier is if they commented it more, or at least described the public methods more thoroughly. 


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> This means taking the explanation one step above just explaining how the computer processes the code. It's easy to follow it step by step, but it is important to understand what those steps accomplish as a whole. If I had to explain to a new CSE142 student how to write an effective comment, I would tell them to write a note to themselves about how they could best utilize that function, and what other functions relate to it.

I would also tell them to comment more thoroughly on the parameters and return statements, as those are easy to overlook, but can contain crucial information regarding understanding what the function does. 


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 5


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> No


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Encourage the student to look up bits of code they don't understand, and encourage students to document the new pieces of knowledge they gained. For example, useful articles they found, or bits of code that stood out or used syntax that was new to them.
